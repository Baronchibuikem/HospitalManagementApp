The main server runs on 127.0.0.1:8000 after your build, localhost:3000 only runs to show you the frontend design.

This application aims at allowing a hospital properly collect data of their patients by registrating them through the patient registration portal in order to properly manage and monitor their progress, it also helps admin to monitor details about various departments, manage staff and have a data collection of it's patients

The registration and login portal links are only supposed to be made available to staff of the organization who will need to be authenticated before other private links are made available to them.

But for testing purposes, heres the link to the authentication portals
